# bspwm-auto-fullscreen
A simple Auto-fullscreen and EWW toggling script for the bspwm window manager

Just like the name says, this is a script i worked on 100% for myself (read carefully, "LIKE") to make nodes/windows in the BSPWM window manager automatically fullscreen and toggle Elkowars Wacky Widgets off
if it is in fullscreen and toggles it back on otherwise, it is a script mostly made for fun, lots of idiosyncratic logic happens here and assumptions that only make sense if you were me working on this.

Would be happy to accept optimization/stylistic/philosophical notes ontop of my project, and thanks for checking out!
